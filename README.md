#### System Features
1. Unified OS, Elastic Deployment: A single operating system that meets the needs of all devices, from small earbuds to large car machines, smartphones, etc., allowing different devices to communicate seamlessly with the same language.

2. Hardware Mutual Aid, Resource Sharing: Each device with GenesisOS is not isolated. At the system level, multiple terminals are integrated into one, becoming a "super terminal", with terminal capabilities helping and sharing each other, bringing a seamless collaborative experience.

3. Develop Once, Deploy Everywhere: Developers can write code once based on the unified distributed application framework and deploy it on multiple terminals.
